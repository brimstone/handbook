=== SecLists

https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/

Lots of wordlists, lots of wordlists... My favorites:

- Passwords/
  ** Leaked-Databases/
     ***  rockyou-75.txt
- Discovery/
  ** Web-Content/
     *** raft-{small,medium,large}-{words,extensions,files,directories}{,-lowercase}.txt

rockyou is ok for passwords.

raft is good for `gobuster`
